You're making a pull request to a branch (probably main) of R_Modules within the PECES GitHub Organization. Please ensure you have done the following.

- [ ] Add a .Rmd file or a .ipynb file that makes up the bulk of your module. 
- [] If you have any supplementary material (PDF, etc.), add a folder for your module so that your supplementary material and notebooks are grouped together.
- [ ] Add a few sentences on your module to the README.md file that explains to content and goals of your module
- [ ] Add any libraries you used to the environment.yml file. You just need to add the library name! Please don't use any functionality that forces us to use old values of the library.

If you want more details on best practices, please see the following guide on the [Pull Requests on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
